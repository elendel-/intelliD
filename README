D Language plugin for JetBrains IntelliJ

Very much incomplete at the moment.

Consists of two modules:

* Dlang, the IntelliJ plugin
* ParseD, a D language lexer/parser written in java

All code is released with the 'unlicense' and is placed in the public domain.
You are free to take it and use for whatever.  Attribution and contributions
are, however, appreciated.
